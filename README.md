# ECG_Capstone
My Capstone ECG Project
To run, install the requirements.txt (There may be extra packages in there, i am working on getting that list to just be whats used in the files i have)
In the MITBIH folder there is two folders, Best_model_arxiv-1805-007994 and Jai_Test_Model. The former is taken from that paper and creates a very good model using the mitbih data. the latter is a model that i have pulled together and it is not very accurate at all. 

The data items are missing from the data folder for the arxiv model as they are to large to upload to github, i have put them into the onedrive folder and they need to be copied into the data folder. Otehr notes in running is i had some difficulty with relative paths being used so the paths for the data items may need to be updated in the code for it to run.
